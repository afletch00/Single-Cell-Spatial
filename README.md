# Cosmx WTA Workshop

## What we will do in this short analysis:
- Explore a spatial single-cell pancreas dataset
- look at different cells types within the pancreas
- Look at where genes are located within certain cells
- Look at clusters and gene expression 
- Run a quick differentially expressed gene analysis
- Visualize DEGs with a volcano plot
- Allow you to explore the dataset on your own

## Things you need to do before class:
- For R:
** Download the most current version of R if you don't already have it (see the document titled `install-R.md` for instructions on downloading R and the libraries you will need to install)

- Download the data from the Box folder I invited you to, and put it in the folder you want to work out of
** The data we will put into R is a single object- so_panc_cosmxWTA_sct.rds. This is a large file of ~2GB
** I also sent you some image files from the spatial run where this public data came from. These are just to look at on your own
